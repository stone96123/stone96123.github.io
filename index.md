## About Me

I'm currently a research fellow at the National University of Singapore, where I collaborate with Prof. [Robby T. Tan](https://tanrobby.github.io/) and Prof. [Mohan Kankanhalli](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~mohan/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Xiamen University, with my research supervised by Prof. [Rongrong Ji](https://mac.xmu.edu.cn/rrji_en/). My research interests lie in the fields of person re-identification and AI-generated image detection.
